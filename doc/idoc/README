INSTALLING INTERACTIVE GUIDE
----------------------------

	actually it just needs to be moved in a directory you can access on an URL,
	and that has PHP4+ support with .PHP file extention.
	Best is to put that in a subdirectory and then access that sub directory,


Basical Apache Installation :

	htt://www.your-website.com/ points to /usr/local/apache/htdocs/ local directory,
	just do :
			yourbox:/home/gnuworld/gnuworld/doc/idoc# cd ..
			yourbox:/home/gnuworld/gnuworld/doc# cp -rp idoc/ /usr/local/apache/htdocs

	then access http://www.you-website.com/idoc/ with your usual web browser.




If you don't know what its all about, but you already have a working website interface (/live)
just copy that 'idoc' directory in you GNUworld website directory (as website/docs/gnuworld/idoc)
and then you should find easy enough how to access it using you usual URL for your GNUworld website
and adding the idoc/ sub directory.


NOTE TO CONTRIBUTORS
--------------------

	This documentation, even tho it doesnt evolve very fast on the coder-com website,
	does evolve sorta fast on my development space, its heavily linked to website interface
	changes so its the more up-to-date as i can, so it hopefully provide a full help over the
	GNUworld installation process.

	If you want to contribute, by proposing more FAQs or if you for example tested it on another
	operating system and can tell me it does work without (or with some) modifications, then i will
	be happy to hear it .. and i encourage you to contact me, even for it being a request to know
	if your idea is not either allready in the TODO list too close, allready done, obsolete due to
	some changes, or whatever before you go any further.
