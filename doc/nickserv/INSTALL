**** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

There must be a path for AC tokens from your cservice (or other 
authenticating service) to NickServ! This will usually mean that all the 
servers between cservice and NickServ MUST BE RUNNING ircu2.10.11. If this 
is not the case, NickServ will not see users authenticating and will not 
be able to function.

It is now possible to run NickServ and CService on the same GNUWorld core.

**** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

Basic Installation Instructions:

1) Create the nickserv db: createdb nickserv

2) Load the NickServ schema: psql nickserv < nickserv.sql

3) Configure to use nickserv: ./configure --enable-modules=nickserv --other-options-you-use

4) Run gnuworld
