**** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

There must be a path for AC tokens from your cservice (or other 
authenticating service) to NickServ! This will usually mean that all the 
servers between cservice and NickServ MUST BE RUNNING ircu2.10.11. If this 
is not the case, NickServ will not see users authenticating and will not 
be able to function.

Currently, NickServ and cservice should not be run on the same gnuworld 
core due to some functionality that still needs to be added. To rephrase: 
if you run cservice and NickServ from the same gnuworld core, NickServ 
will not function as advertised. This will be fixed as soon as possible.

**** IMPORTANT NOTE ****

Basic Installation Instructions:

1) Create the nickserv db: createdb nickserv
