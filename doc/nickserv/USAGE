NickServ is a service to aid users in preventing unauthorised use of their
chosen nickname.

Having a working service on the network that will authenticate users and
send out AC tokens IS A MUST. Without this, NickServ WILL NOT WORK.

For a user to interact with NickServ in any way, they must have authed
to that service and received usermode +r. NickServ will politely decline
to talk to anyone that is not authed in this manner. If any of this
doesn't make sense to you, it roughly translates to 'you need to be
running ircu2.10.11 and a recent version of mod.cservice'.

Enough of that.

For a user to set up autokill on their chosen nick, they must do the
following:

1) Authenticate with cservice and obtain usermode +r. Their
authenticated nick is the only nick they will be able to enable NickServ
services on.

2) Register with NickServ. This is done simply by '/msg NS register'. NS
will create a new user record for that nickname and inform the user that
it has done so.

3) Set NickServ to autokill. This is done by '/msg NS set autokill on'.
NS will reply that AUTOKILL has been set to ON, and from then on the
nick will be protected.

Should the user wish to disable autokill in the future, they can simply
'/msg NS set autokill off'.
