bringing GNUWorld to the free society.

founder.  His insight and talent have brought this project to the
world.  Orlando is responsible for the original design and
implementation from which gnuworld is born.

programmer.  He has helped with some of the most difficult areas of ircu
and gnuworld.  His contributions are immeasurable.

modules.  Greg is the father of the cservice module, which I
(ripper_) continually break.

development and testing of gnuworld.  You really made a lot of sacrifices
and had to put up with my complaining :)
