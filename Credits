This file is here to recognize the many people who are
responsible for bringing GNUWorld to the free society.

Orlando Bassatto (nextie) - Orlando is the project's original
founder.  His insight and talent have brought this project to the
world.  Orlando is responsible for the original design and
implementation from which gnuworld is born.

Andrea Cocito (Nemesi) - Andrea is a very gifted and dedicated
programmer.  He has helped with some of the most difficult
areas of ircu and gnuworld.  His contributions are immeasurable.

Perry (Isomer) - Lots of great ideas and a calming attitude in
times of panic.  Perry is the project manager, putting The Man 
into his place.

Greg (Gte) - Lots of real world testing and development of
gnuworld and its modules.  Greg is the father of the cservice 
module, which I (ripper_) continually break.

Tomer (MrBean) - Creator of the ccontrol (oper services) module.
Tomer has generated a huge amount of code, and withstood the 
weight of my (ripper_) nitpicking.  Good job on your first major 
project :)

Jeekay (jeekay@netgamers.org) - Creator of the dronescan module.
He has provided a wealth of new information, as well as asking
lots of tough questions.

Stephane (mbuna) - Silently challenging me to do better, plus
normal type support and feedback :)

Julien (nighty) - Development of the web interface almost
entirely on his own.  This system looks good, and works even 
better.  Thanks for all of your tireless hours without tangible 
rewards!

ZAMBOO (zamboo@under-web.net) Lots of bug reporting and diligent
efforts to try out all the possibilities.  Thanks :)

OUTSider - Always testing and retesting, looking for bugs...you found 
some! Also thanks for contributing some code.

Doug (seiki) - Thanks a lot for letting me thrash your machine
during development and testing of gnuworld.  You really made a 
lot of sacrifices and had to put up with my complaining :)

Ben (Obike) - Enormous help with the php security issues, and
the web interface in general.  Your expertise was invaluable.

Keir - Helping with new ideas and finding bugs, testing in the real
world.  Keir has put forth some excellent ideas on enhancements for
gnuworld.

Marc Dondlinger (aka HiGhPwR) <highpwr@quake.lu>
Huge amounts of bug reporting, a loyal user without whom this
project would never have been ready :)

Kevin Mitchell (Kev) - Helping to fill in the gaps, there are lots!

David Henriksen <david@itwebnet.dk> (Plexus@IRC)
Real world testing and implementation, bug finding.  Youve helped
this project with a lot of issues.

Raystonn <raystonn@hotmail.com> - Thanks for helping with some of
the finer points :)

Maniac <maniac@krushnet.org> - Thanks for lots of bug fixing and
testing...you really like to pick apart our code!
