User FAQ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Is mod.Chanfix like channel registration?

No. Not all all. mod.Chanfix is a neutral entity which can fix a stable channel (this
means that it has existed for at least several days, and has had a group of stable ops)
in emergencies. The two emergencies when mod.Chanfix can help are if the channel becomes
opless, or if the channel is taken over.

* When does my channel qualify for mod.Chanfix?

Every channel with at least 4 clients in it will get points.

* How do I get a score?

Every 5 minutes mod.Chanfix will look at the opped clients in each channel that have
enough clients. All of the clients that are idented (no ~ in front of their username)
will get a point. See the examples for more information.

* How many points do I need?

You need at least 163 points (4% of the maximum) for mod.Chanfix to reop you. Below that,
mod.Chanfix doesn't do anything. This means your channel must be at least 163 / 12 = 13.6
hours old.

* My channel is opless and I have a score, why isn't mod.Chanfix opping me?

mod.Chanfix can take up to an hour to fix an opless channel. The higher your score, the
faster you are opped. So be patient. Oh, and if your score is below 163, well, you won't
be opped.

* After 2 hours, mod.Chanfix has still not been to my channel! What's going on?

The most probable explanation is that you have fewer than 3 clients in your channel. You
must have at least 4 clients in your opless channel before mod.Chanfix will come to fix it.
