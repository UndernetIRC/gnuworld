Example:

Let's look at an example channel, #mod.Chanfix. Currently, the following people
are on #mod.Chanfix:

Users on #mod.Chanfix:

[@Beige ] [@cryogen] [@sabre2th] [+cfan    ] [morfie]
[@cfgaar] [@Garion ] [@smurf   ] [+Domilijn] [as4   ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 10 nicks [6 ops, 2 voices, 2 normal]

Here is a list of all the hostmasks of the users on #mod.Chanfix:

@ Beige        beige@oper.suid.sh
@ cfgaar      garion@open.chanfix
@ cryogen   ~cryogen@bin.bash.sh
@ Garion      garion@hub.nl
@ sabre2th  sabre2th@feed.your.supermind
@ smurf        smurf@80.60.12.241
+ cfan          cfan@jd-163-76.doc.aca.mmu.ac.uk
+ Domilijn  domilijn@kansloos.carnique.nl
  morfie        morf@217-195-236-172.dsl.esined.net
  as4             as@CPE-65-28-140-90.neb.rr.com

Now, #mod.Chanfix has existed for several weeks now, so there are scores for
the channel in the mod.Chanfix database. These scores are:

1. 3651 garion@open.chanfix
2. 3548 beige@oper.suid.sh
3. 3498 domilijn@kansloos.carnique.nl
4. 3289 garion@hub.nl
5. 3176 ivo@echelon.schaapje.org
6. 3006 sabre2th@feed.your.supermind
7. 1252 smurf@80.60.12.241

As you can see, cryogen, whilst being opped, doesn't have a record in the
database. The reason that he doesn't have a score is that he is not idented;
you can see this because he has a tilde (~) before his username.
Let's ask C what he thinks about the status of the channel as it is now.

<Garion> score #mod.Chanfix
<C> Top 10 scores for channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 3651, 3548, 3498, 3289, 3176, 3006, 1252.
<C> Top 10 scores for ops in channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 3651, 3548, 3289, 3006, 1252.
<C> Top 10 scores for non-ops in channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 3498.

From these scores you can see that the scores of the opped people are the same
as the top scores in the database, so the channel is currently with the
"rightful" owners.
