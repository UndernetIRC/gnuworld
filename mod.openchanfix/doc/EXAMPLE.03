Example:

Someone has taken over #mod.Chanfix, set it invite-only and kicked and banned
almost all the regulars. The situation:

Users on #mod.Chanfix:
[@IHateC ] [@takebot2] [as4     ] [henkje]
[@takebot] [@v       ] [Domilijn] [p33n  ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 8 nicks [4 ops, 0 voices, 4 normal]

The modes on the channel are as follows:

+iknmst closed
+b *!chanfix@open.chanfix
+b *!beige@oper.suid.sh
+b *!garion@*

Asking mod.Chanfix about the scores gives the following result:

<Garion> score #mod.Chanfix
<C> Top 10 scores for channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 3651, 3548, 3498, 3289, 3176, 3006, 1252, 7, 6, 6.
<C> Top 10 scores for ops in channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 7, 6, 6, 3.
<C> Top 10 scores for non-ops in channel "#mod.Chanfix" in the database:
<C> 3498.

From these scores, it is clear that the channel has been taken over. Nobody
with high scores is currently opped. So, time for a manual chanfix:

<Garion> chanfix #mod.Chanfix
<C> Manual chanfix acknowledged for channel "#mod.Chanfix".

This manual chanfix occurs in two stages. First, all modes of the channel are
cleared:

* TS for #mod.Chanfix changed from 1029226431 to 1029226430
* irc.open.chanfix sets mode #mod.Chanfix: -ik
* irc.open.chanfix sets mode #mod.Chanfix: -oooo IHateC takebot takebot2 v
* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* irc.open.chanfix sets mode #mod.Chanfix: +o C
<C> Channel fix in progress, please stand by.
* C sets mode #mod.Chanfix: -bbb *!chanfix@open.chanfix *!beige@oper.suid.sh
*!garion@*
* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has left #mod.Chanfix

The channel is clear and open again:

Users on #mod.Chanfix:
[as4     ] [henkje] [p33n   ] [takebot2]
[Domilijn] [IHateC] [takebot] [v       ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 8 nicks [0 ops, 0 voices, 8 normal]

Now, mod.Chanfix will wait a while to allow the channel regulars to rejoin the
channel:

* Beige (beige@oper.suid.sh) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* Garion (garion@hub.nl) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* cfgaar (garion@open.chanfix) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* cryogen (~cryogen@bin.bash.sh) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* sabre2th (sabre2th@feed.your.supermind) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* henkje (henk@i.aml33t.cx) has parted #mod.Chanfix
And after that pause, C will enter to give ops to the people who deserve it:
* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* irc.open.chanfix sets mode #mod.Chanfix: +o C
* C sets mode #mod.Chanfix: +oooo cfgaar Beige Domilijn Garion
* <C> 4 clients should have been opped.
* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has left #mod.Chanfix []

This leaves the channel in the following state:

Users on #mod.Chanfix:
[@Beige ] [@Domilijn] [as4    ] [IHateC] [sabre2th] [takebot2]
[@cfgaar] [@Garion  ] [cryogen] [p33n  ] [takebot ] [v       ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 12 nicks [4 ops, 0 voices, 8 normal]

Back with its rightful owners.
