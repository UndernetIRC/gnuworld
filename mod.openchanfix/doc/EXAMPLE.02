Example:

Users on #mod.Chanfix:

[@Beige ] [as4 ] [cryogen ] [Garion] [sabre2th]
[+cfgaar] [cfan] [Domilijn] [morfie] [smurf   ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 10 nicks [1 ops, 1 voices, 8 normal]

Beige's connection has some problems:

* Beige (beige@oper.suid.sh) has quit [Connection reset by peer]
* Beige (beige@oper.suid.sh) has joined #mod.Chanfix

The situation is now like this:
Users on #mod.Chanfix:

[+cfgaar] [as4 ] [cryogen ] [Garion] [sabre2th]
[ Beige ] [cfan] [Domilijn] [morfie] [smurf   ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 10 nicks [0 ops, 1 voices, 9 normal]

mod.Chanfix will detect that #mod.Chanfix has become opless. Then it will look
in the database if there are scores known for #mod.Chanfix, and it will check
if there are currently clients with high enough scores present in the channel.
If that is the case, and here that certainly is, C will join the channel and op
a few clients:

* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has joined #mod.Chanfix
* irc.open.chanfix sets mode #mod.Chanfix: +o C
* C sets mode #mod.Chanfix: +oooo cfgaar Beige Domilijn Garion
* <C> 4 clients should have been opped.
* C (chanfix@open.chanfix) has left #mod.Chanfix []

After the fix, the channel looks like this:
Users on #mod.Chanfix:

[@Beige ] [@Domilijn] [as4 ] [cryogen] [sabre2th]
[@cfgaar] [@Garion  ] [cfan] [morfie ] [smurf   ]
#mod.Chanfix: Total of 10 nicks [4 ops, 0 voices, 6 normal]

In OPLOGIC you can find out why these 4 clients have been opped and not any others.
