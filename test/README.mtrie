The mtrie* suite is used to test the gnuworld matching trie (MTrie).

mtrie
-----
Reads a socket file, putting all hostnames found in "N" commands into
an MTrie.  It then provides an interactive menu system allowing you to
search/insert/delete items in the MTrie.

mtrie_perf
----------
Reads a socket file, putting all hostnames found in "N" commands into
an MTrie.  This program will invoke the MTrie's dumpDebug() information
into a file like "mtrie_perf_<name of socket file>".  This file includes
information about each node in the MTrie: level number, number of
subtrees (sub nodes), and number of values stored at that node.  It is
in a syntax that should be easily parsed by some other program.

mtrie_perf_summary
------------------
This program reads an mtrie_perf output file and spits out some useful
information about the MTrie, like max level, average number of values
per node, etc.

mtrie_load
----------
Perform load testing of the matching trie, comparing it to a multimap.  It 
reads a file with N (optionally wildcard) strings to search for.  The 
default files are mtrie.match*.  This program accepts a handful of command 
line arguments and should be easy to use.  By default a multimap is used, 
add -t to the command line to use a matching trie instead.
