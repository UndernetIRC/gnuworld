This program is designed to hammer the signal handling system looking for 
flaws with GNUWorld's Signal class.

To do some testing:

1) run test_signal
2) run kill_mult

kill_test will send a group of known signals to the pid found in 
signal.pid (the pid file for the signal program from step 1).

kill_mult just runs kill_test a bunch of times.
