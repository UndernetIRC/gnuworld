[ ] - Add flood check for lame users

[ ] - Add update flags for oper (oper<->admin<->coder)

[ ] - Add glinechan / badchan

[ ] - Fix a minor bug in the suspend checking while loging in

[ ] - Fix a bug in lastcom, not showing the commands in the correct order

[ ] - Cleanup ... dont need to say how much its needed in here

- Truncate output of any commands which will flood an oper 
(access,lastcomm)
- chaninfo output should also include human readable time
- op command should op the requesting oper if no nicks are provided
- same with deop
- scangline doesn't work
- "help translate" needs extra space between syntax and description (or is 
it just my terminal?)
