Follow these steps to setup the database for the ccontrol module.  This
file assumes that postgresql is running and configured, and that you have
access to add and modify databases within it.

Create the database
-------------------
> createdb ccontrol

Note that this assumes that the ccontrol database does not already exist.

Load the schema
---------------
Make sure you are in the gnuworld/doc directory.

> psql ccontrol < ccontrol.sql
> psql ccontrol < ccontrol.help.sql
