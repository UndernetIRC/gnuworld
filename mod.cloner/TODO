Add more all-clones commands.
 Example: ? what else ?

Add per-clone commands.
 Example: SPAWN, JOIN, PART, QUIT.

Split SHOWCOMMANDS and HELP into two commands.
 SHOWCOMMANDS will list all the commands.
 HELP will give help on each command.
 Example: HELP <topic/command>

What else would be good to add? :)
