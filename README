Welcome to GNUWorld
------------------

GNUWorld is an IRC services server.  This server hosts several virtual
bots that perform IRC network and channel functions.

GNUWorld's homepage is located at http://gnuworld.sourceforge.net.
From this page you may obtain the latest information about GNUWorld.

To use GNUWorld, you need a few of the basics:
	- An uplink IRC server.  Make sure the U lines are set properly
	  for the bots you wish for GNUWorld to host.
	- A machine to run GNUWorld.  Keep in mind that GNUWorld uses as
	  much bandwidth as any other IRC server on your network.
	- GNUWorld will also use quite a bit of memory and processor
	  time, though not normally nearly as much as other IRC servers
	  on your network.

The first step you need to take is to obtain a copy of GNUWorld.  GNUWorld
is software written under the GPL.  A copy of the license is included with
this distribution.

You can obtain GNUWorld through the above web site.  The preferred method
of getting a copy of GNUWorld is through CVS.  Issue the following command
to log into the anonymous CVS server:

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gnuworld.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuworld
 login

When prompted for a password, hit the return key.

Next you need to check out a copy of the latest version of GNUWorld:

cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.gnuworld.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/gnuworld
 co gnuworld

(Execute the above command on a single line in your shell.)  This will
create a directory under your current directory named "gnuworld" in which
all of GNUWorld's files will be placed.

Installing GNUWorld
------------------

If you used the CVS method above, you may proceed directly to the
Building GNUWorld section below.  Otherwise you downloaded a tar gzipped
copy of GNUWorld.

Unpack the archive as follows:

gzip -cd gnuworld.xxx.tar.gz | tar xf -

where xxx is the version of GNUWorld you have obtained.

Building GNUWorld
----------------

In order to build GNUWorld, you will need a compiler which supports the
ANSI C++ Standard.  GNUmake is also recommended (gmake).

Change into the gnuworld directory, and run the configuration script:

cd gnuworld
./configure

This will build the Makefiles that GNUWorld will use to compile its source
code.  Compile gnuworld with the command:

make

This should build the executable binary into the directory gnuworld/bin
(./bin from your current directory).

Configuring GNUWorld
-------------------

Change into the bin directory:

cd bin

In here you will find several .conf files.  These are the files that
GNUWorld uses to configure itself and its bots.  The file "localhost.conf"
contains sufficient information for GNUWorld to connect to an IRC uplink
server located on the local (127.0.0.1) machine.

The format of the configuration files should be fairly straightforward.
GNUWorld also supports several command line options obtained by running the
command:

GNUWorld -h

In order to run GNUWorld, all you need to pass it is the name of the
configuration file.  To have GNUWorld run and connect to the IRC server
located at localhost:6667, issue the following command:

GNUWorld -f localhost.conf

That's it!  You will now have GNUWorld running!

Should you have any problems, please email us at
gnuworld-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.  Don't forget to include a print
out of the compiler errors, if any, or the logs from the problem.  It
helps to run GNUWorld in verbose mode using the -c command line
option.  Please also include OS and compiler type and version.

You may also visit http://gnuworld.sourceforge.net to submit an online
bug report.
