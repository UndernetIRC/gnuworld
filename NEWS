The newest versions (v7.3.x) of postgresql do not come with c++ support by 
default.  These libraries have been moved to a separate project.  However, 
that project is not yet mature enough to compile no most systems.  
Therefore, we recommend you use the latest version of pgsql v7.2.x 
(currently 7.2.4).
